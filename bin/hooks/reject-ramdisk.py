_ = r"""
reject an upload if the target folder is on a ramdisk; useful when you
have a volume where some folders inside are ramdisks but others aren't

example usage as global config:
    --xbu I,bin/hooks/reject-ramdisk.py

example usage as a volflag (per-volume config):
    -v srv/inc:inc:r:rw,ed:c,xbu=I,bin/hooks/reject-ramdisk.py
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    (share filesystem-path srv/inc as volume /inc,
     readable by everyone, read-write for user 'ed',
     running this plugin on all uploads with the params listed below)

example usage as a volflag in a copyparty config file:
    [/inc]
      srv/inc
      accs:
        r: *
        rw: ed
      flags:
        xbu: I,bin/hooks/reject-ramdisk.py

parameters explained,
    I = import; do not fork / subprocess

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    because this hook is imported inside copyparty, you need to
    be EXCEPTIONALLY CAREFUL to avoid side-effects, for example
    DO NOT os.chdir() or anything like that, and also make sure
    that the name of this file is unique (cannot be the same as
    an existing python module/library)
