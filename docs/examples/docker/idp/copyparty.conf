# not actually YAML but lets pretend:

# example config for how copyparty can be used with an identity
# provider, replacing the built-in authentication/authorization
# mechanism, and instead expecting the reverse-proxy to provide
# the requester's username (and possibly a group-name, for
# optional group-based access control)
#
# the filesystem-path `/w` is used as the storage location
# because that is the data-volume in the docker containers,
# because a deployment like this (with an IdP) is more commonly
# seen in containerized environments -- but this is not required
#
# the example group "su" (super-user) is the admins group


[global]
  e2dsa  # enable file indexing and filesystem scanning
  e2ts   # enable multimedia indexing
  ansi   # enable colors in log messages

  # enable IdP support by expecting username/groupname in
  # http-headers provided by the reverse-proxy; header "X-IdP-User"
  # will contain the username, "X-IdP-Group" the groupname
  idp-h-usr: x-idp-user
  idp-h-grp: x-idp-group

  # but copyparty will refuse to accept those headers unless you
  # tell it the LAN IP of the reverse-proxy to expect them from,
  # preventing malicious users from pretending to be the proxy;
  # pay attention to the warning message in the logs and then
  # adjust the following config option accordingly:
  xff-src: 192.168.0.0/16

  # or just allow all LAN / private IPs (probably good enough):
  xff-src: lan

  # an additional, optional security measure is to expect a
  # secret header name from the reverse-proxy; you can enable
  # this feature by setting the header-name to expect here:
  #idp-h-key: shangala-bangala

  # convenient debug option:
  # log all incoming request headers from the proxy
