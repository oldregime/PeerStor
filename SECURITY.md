# Security Policy

if you hit something extra juicy pls let me know on one of the following:
* email -- `copyparty@ocv.ze` except `ze` should be `me`
* [github private vulnerability report](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/security/advisories/new), wow that form is complicated

no bug bounties sorry! all i can offer is greetz in the release notes
